Disclaimer: It's been a long time since I last used NextJS. I did a little research before starting development
Time Spent: around 5 hours

## Features

- story list page - client side rendering for instant filtering, sortable score/karma
- story detail - server side rendering, fallback to not-found page if story not found
- light/dark theme
- API services for DRY pattern
- /api/story route to hide external API endpoint
- Show loading state on page load
- Using SCSS best practices

## 3rd party libraries

- axios - xhr request
- lucide-react - for icons
- react-loading-skeleton - for loading state
- react-timeago - for date/time formatting

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
